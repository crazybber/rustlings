## books and articles

For the Arc exercise check out the chapter
[Shared-State Concurrency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-03-shared-state.html) of the Rust Book.

For the Iterator exercise check out the chapters

[Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html) of the Rust Book
and the
[Iterator documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/).

Do not adjust your monitors-- iterators1.rs is indeed missing. Iterators is a challenging topic, so we're leaving space for a simpler exercise!
